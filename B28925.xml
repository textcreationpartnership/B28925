            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Representation of Colonell <hi>Inglesby's</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment in the Garrison of <hi>Oxford,</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of our selves and all the Nation, <hi>Sept. 7. 1649</hi> directed to all the Souldiers of the Army, and to the whole Nation.</head>
            <p>WE having for these severall years since by sad experience, seen how the land of our nativity hath lyen in misery, and almost wasted, doth move us now out of compassion to speak in behalfe of ourselves and the rest of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which we hope all honest men will adhere to; For they are not new things that we desire, they are of two years standing, expressed in the Ingagement of the Army at New-mark-heath the 5. of <hi>Iune</hi> 1647 and by Agreement of the People, offered to the consideration of our foure friends in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> as an unparallel'd expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for the settlement of the Nation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we doe declare, that we will endeavour to attain the choyce of two Officers &amp; two Souldiers out of every Regiment, according to our fore-said engagement, to be at the Head-quarters of the Army, to act in our
<pb facs="tcp:207874:2"/>own and the Nations behalfe, to accomplish the expectation of the Nation, who wait for freedome but behold bondage, for case but behold oppression as at this time.</p>
            <p>We doe declare that we will endeavour to obtaine such sure security to our selves &amp; to the Nation, according to the nature of our fore-said engagement, that we might not be left to the willes of men, to exercise their pleasure on us for things done in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the service of the Nation.</p>
            <p>We Declare, that we will endeavour to our uttermost to free the Nation from that intollerable burthen of Excise, which eats into the very bones of the Poore people of this Nation, and also that insufferable cut-throat <hi>Tythe,</hi> which is the fift part of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wealth.</p>
            <p>We Declare against the new accustomed way of trying Causes by these corrupt Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, who make a trade of the Peoples ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance: But that the Law be translated into our own native tongue, that so the Law may be understood: That there may be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty granted to those to plead their own Cause (who can) or to imploy any other
<pb facs="tcp:207874:2"/>friend, who will not for gaine destroy the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as many have been by long dependence, it may be two three or foure years, that they having not mony to fee those greedy Catterpillers, they must loose their right.</p>
            <p>We doe Declare that we will with our lives and fortunes, stand fast, and joyne with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for these just and reasonable things now in our thoughts to procure for the Nation, For we doe desire not in the least to set up any particular party or interest, but to obtain good for the whole, that all may injoy benefit. We hope this will not seem strange to you, that we thus present our resolution to you, it is not persons but principles of righteousnesse, that God willing we will set up: we doe it out of a tender regard that we have to the Nation, and to each other of our fellow Souldiers, that we might not plunder and destroy one another, as we have lately had example, and it is now endeavoured by our Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, which will not in the least grant our just desires, which is, that two Officers and two Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, of every Regiment be admitted to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, to be at the Head-quarters of the Army, to prosecute those things that are not perfected, in our own and the Nations behalfe, but they will
<pb facs="tcp:207874:3"/>not be acquainted with us in such a choyce, which denyall to so just a demand, doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest how we are endeavoured to be robd of our open and publike declard rights, as Souldiers &amp; Commoners of the Nation, by particular men, which all men in our condition, can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no better, it may be worse, (if possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) if not in time prevented, by an unanimous consent of all our fellow Souldiers, this is one of the highest acts of slavery that men live under, especially to those who have been faithfull to the death, for our officers to come into our quarters and rifle and take away what they please, which some of us can by experience speak, out of a deep sence of this our miserable condition, we are constrained to trouble you with these few lines, hoping the sence of them will take upon your spirits, so that you will afford us all the help and assistance you can, and not to be imployed as a hired mercenary Army, to cut the throats of your fellow Souldiers. Signed in the behalfe of our selves, and by consent of our fellow Souldiers.</p>
